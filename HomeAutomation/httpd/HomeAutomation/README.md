This directory contains scripts written to the cgi interface, but are designed to run in-process in the apache server. CGI scripts by convention normally run each in its own process, every time the URL is accessed. But these scripts need to be able to see and possibly change the run time settings in other bits of diysha, so they are set up in the httpd conf file such that mod_perl runs everything in this directory in-process. Only perl scripts (starting with #!/usr/local/bin/perl) will work in this directory.
